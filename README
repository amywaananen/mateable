This repo provides source code for an R package called
mateable. This package contains functions that
help the study of flowering phenology.

Using the package devtools, you can use the following code to
automatically install package mateable.
This package requires compiling C++ code using Rcpp so if you
have loaded Rcpp at any point during your current R or RStudio
session, you'll have to either detach it or close RStudio and
open it again.

install.packages("devtools") # if you don't already have it
library(devtools)
install_github("danhan52/mateable"")
library(mateable)
?mateable

You should see a help page. Look at the index link to see what
functions are available. Copy and paste the example code to see what
happens!

Let me know if you have any questions.

TODO: Look at all documentation to make sure it's not silly
