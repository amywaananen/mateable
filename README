This repo provides source code for an R package called
mateable. This package contains functions that
help the study of flowering phenology.

To get started using the package, go to the page
https://bitbucket.org/swagenius/echphenology/downloads
and download the master zip file (for Windows) or gz file
(for Mac).

Then open R and select this menu option > Packages > Install
package(s) from local zip files...

Browse to the file you downloaded and select it. You
should get a message like this:
"package ‘mateable’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked"

Then, at the command prompt, type
library(mateable)

Type this to see if it loaded
?mateable

You should see a help page. Look at the index link to see what
functions are available. Copy and paste the example code to see what
happens!

Let me know if you have any questions.

The below information doesn't currently work for Windows. There's a
compliler error when you try it.
