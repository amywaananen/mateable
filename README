If you install package devtools, then you can use the following
code to automatically install package mateable. This package requires
compiling C++ code using Rcpp so if you have loaded Rcpp at any point
during your current R or RStudio session, you'll have to either detach
it or close RStudio and open it again.

library(devtools)
install_github("danhan52/mateable"")
library(mateable)
?mateable

TODO: Look at all documentation to make sure it's not silly
      update README to have all the information necessary to use this
