Description: This package can be used while studying anything that mates.
  With functions in this package, researchers can visualize spatial,
  temporal, and genetic mating potential data.
  It provides several functions that implement both previously described
  and novel methods to assess synchrony, proximity, and compatibility
  in mating populations.
